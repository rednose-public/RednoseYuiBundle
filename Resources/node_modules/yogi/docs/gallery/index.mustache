<h2>before we get started</h2>

<p>
`yogi` can talk to the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUILibrary.com</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>,
take a look at the <a href="../auth">authentication with yogi</a> docs to get setup.
</p>

<h2>getting started</h2>

<p>
`yogi` contains everything you will ever need to create and maintain a quality YUI Gallery module.
</p>

<h2>gallery improvements</h2>

<p>
`yogi` officially fully supports new Gallery modules. The YUI Gallery upgrade is deployed and will be
used as the default gallery system from now on. These updates came with a few new features:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Builds are done with <a href="http://yui.github.com/shifter">Shifter</a></li>
    <li>Modules are tested with `yogi`</li>
    <li>Modules are no longer required to live in a fork of the `yui3-gallery` repo.</li>
    <li>Modules that have examples, api docs and tests will be integrated into the YUI website.</li>
</ul>

<p>More information on converting an existing module <a href="#upgrading-an-old-module">can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2>creating a new module</h2>

<p>
Creating a new gallery module is as simple as: `yogi create mymodule`
</p>

<p>This will check the website to ensure that the module name is free and 
create the module on the YUI website.</p>

<h3>initializing a new module</h3>

<p>
`yogi` also knows how to create a module's infrastructure too, just add `--init` and she
will do her thing. Here's a step by step example:
</p>

<h3>verifying the module</h3>

<p>
`yogi` gathers a little information about your local environment and asks
you if everything looks ok:
</p>

```terminal
$ yogi create testmodule --init

yogi [info]  using yogi@0.0.35 on node@0.8.14
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
yogi [info]  yogi found this git origin:   git@github.com:davglass/gallery.git
yogi [info]  and this repo:                gallery
yogi [info]  using this path:              src/testmodule
yogi [info]  of type:                      js
yogi [info]  with this license:            YUI BSD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
yogi [info]  checking if testmodule is free
yogi [info]  module name is free
are you sure you want to request this name with the above information? [Y/n] y

```

<p>
You can change the default options by passing them in explicitly when calling `yogi create`.
For example, `yogi create mymodule --type=css` will create a CSS module called "mymodule".
</p>


<h3>requesting to reserve your name</h3>
<p>
Next she will actually perform the request and reserve the module name for you:
</p>

```terminal
yogi [info]  yogi is requesting this module for you
yogi [info]  testmodule was created successfully
```

<h3>creating your stuff</h3>

<p>
Next she will again check the environment and you can verify that she's doing
the right thing for your module.
</p>

```terminal
yogi [info]  initializing new module with the following info:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yogi [info]  yogi found this git origin:   git@github.com:davglass/gallery.git
yogi [info]  in this location:             /ssd/home/yui/src/davglass-gallery/.git
yogi [info]  and this repo:                gallery
yogi [info]  using this path:              src/testmodule
yogi [info]  of type:                      js
yogi [info]  with this license:            YUI BSD
yogi [info]  
yogi [info]  yogi will create this module here:
yogi [info]    /ssd/home/yui/src/davglass-gallery/src/testmodule
yogi [info]  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

does the above look correct? may yogi create this module? [y/N] y
```

<h3>getting things done</h3>

<p>
Now that she has all the information she needs, `yogi` will proceed to create your module.
</p>

```terminal
yogi [info]  creating module (testmodule) in: /ssd/home/yui/src/davglass-gallery/src/testmodule
yogi [info]  creating default directory structure
yogi [info]  directories created, processing files

yogi [info]  module created, here's what yogi did for you:

   src/testmodule
       ├── HISTORY.md
       ├── README.md
       ├── assets/
       ├── build.json
       ├── css/
       ├── docs/
       │  ├── component.json
       │  └── index.mustache
       ├── js/
       │  └── gallery-testmodule.js
       ├── meta/
       │  └── gallery-testmodule.json
       └── tests/
          └── unit/
             ├── index.html
             └── js/
                └── tests.js
       

yogi [info]  yogi took 0.06 seconds to create this module
```

<p>Now you can instantly start coding, documenting and testing your new module. Since she created this module in the new standardized format,
all of her built in tools are available for you. Once you're ready to deploy, check out how `yogi` can help you <a href="../cdn">make a cdn request</a>.</p>

<h2>upgrading an old module</h2>

<p>
Now that you don't have to keep your gallery modules in a fork of the `yui3-gallery` repo, you might want to move them somewhere else. `yogi` can help 
you with that too!
</p>

<p>
There are two things that you can change to help you maintain your old modules in a better way. The `repo` name and the `path` to the module. All 
current modules have a default of `yui3-gallery` and `src/[module name]` as defaults. `yogi` allows you to view and change these keys so you
can update your modules when and how you want.
</p>

<p>
For this example, we will use `my-old-module` as the module to be converted. The first thing you do is create your new gallery repo on Github, we'll use `my-gallery` as the name.
After creating this repo and initializing it with `git init`, you copy `yui3-gallery/src/gallery-my-old-module/` into the new `my-gallery/src/gallery-my-old-module`.
</p>

<p>Now that you have moved the old source into the new repo, you can now have `yogi` update this to the new module format:</p>

```terminal
$ cd my-gallery/src/gallery-my-old-module
$ yogi update
```

<p>`yogi` will run through a process similar to a new module above and convert your existing module over. It will even pull your landing page document
from the old Gallery site and import that into Selleck doc format.</p>

<p>Once the module has been converted, you may now use other yogi commands on it. The one we will use to switch the `repo` and `path`
is `yogi info`. Executing `yogi info` from this module's directory should output something like this:</p>

```terminal
$ cd my-gallery/src/gallery-my-old-module
$ yogi info

yogi [info]  using yogi@0.0.35 on node@0.8.14

   username/gallery-my-old-module

   created: Fri Nov 09 2012 11:07:59 GMT-0600 (CST)

       clone this module:
           git clone git://github.com/username/yui3-gallery.git
           cd my-gallery/src/gallery-my-old-module

```

<h3>Changing the repo</h3>

<p>
Now we can see that the repo for this module is defaulted to `yui3-gallery`, we can change this with:
</p>

```terminal

$ yogi info --set-repo=my-gallery

yogi [info]  using yogi@0.0.35 on node@0.8.14
yogi [info]  updating info for this module:
yogi [info]  setting repo to: my-gallery

   username/gallery-my-old-module

   created: Fri Nov 09 2012 11:07:59 GMT-0600 (CST)

       clone this module:
           git clone git://github.com/username/my-gallery.git
           cd my-gallery/src/gallery-my-old-module


```

<p>Now the repo name has changed, on the next CDN deployment the Gallery build will pull this module from this repo.</p>

<h3>Changing the path to the source</h3>

<p>
From above, we can see the path to the source is: `src/gallery-my-old-module`, but what if we want this module to be `old-one` locally?
`yogi info` is here to help again:
</p>



```terminal

$ yogi info --set-path=old-one

yogi [info]  using yogi@0.0.35 on node@0.8.14
yogi [info]  updating info for this module:
yogi [info]  setting path to: old-one

   username/gallery-my-old-module

   created: Fri Nov 09 2012 11:07:59 GMT-0600 (CST)

       clone this module:
           git clone git://github.com/username/my-gallery.git
           cd my-gallery/src/old-one
    
$ cd ../
$ mv gallery-my-old-module old-one
    
```

<p>Now the path name has changed, on the next CDN deployment the Gallery build will pull this module from this path.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong> <em>You can also use them both at once like: `yogi info --set-path=src/old-one --set-repo=my-gallery`</em></p>
