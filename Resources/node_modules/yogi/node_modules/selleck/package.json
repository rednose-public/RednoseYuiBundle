It's still young and\nevolving rapidly, but you may find it useful.\n\nSee <http://yui.github.com/selleck/> for detailed information and usage\ninstructions, as well as an example of the kinds of docs Selleck generates.\n\nIf you'd like to see more, [check out this sample][ac-docs] of the YUI 3\nAutoComplete docs and examples, generated using Selleck.\n\n[ac-docs]:http://dl.dropbox.com/u/131998/yui/docs/autocomplete/index.html\n\n\nBuild Status\n------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yui/selleck.png)](http://travis-ci.org/yui/selleck)\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Yahoo!
